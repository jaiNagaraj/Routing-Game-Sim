# Routing Game Equilibrium Convergence Simulator

## Purpose
In the fall of 2023, I conducted an independent study in the field of game theory, and decided to apply my knowledge to this project (along with [FangEngine](https://github.com/jaiNagaraj/FangEngine)). It serves as a neat learning tool that puts theory into practice visually, showing the powerful capabilities of games that admit a potential function in calculating equilibrium via Potential Function Minimization.

## Details
Uses simple JavaScript and HTML Canvas to do the job. Example graphs were taken from <i>Algorithmic Game Theory</i> by Tim Roughgarden, Noam Nisan et al., as well as Vincent Knight's online lecture notes of his course on Game Theory at Cardiff University. All code was created by and belongs to Jai Nagaraj.
